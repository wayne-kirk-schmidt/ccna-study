## How to Use These Terms
When you encounter a term, ask:
- What decision does this term help me make?
- What ambiguity does it remove?
- Which OSI layer does it anchor to?

## Anchors
- **Latency**: Time, not speed — affects user experience
- **Throughput**: Capacity over time — affects saturation
- **Control Plane**: Decision-making logic
- **Data Plane**: Packet forwarding behavior
