# Questions & Thinking Drills

⬅️ Back to [Main README](../README.md)

## Purpose
This directory trains **reasoning habits**, not memorization.

You are not expected to answer questions immediately.
Instead, practice:
- identifying the OSI layer
- naming the key identifier (IP, MAC, port, etc.)
- choosing the *next best question* to ask
