# Design Thinking

⬅️ Back to [Questions README](README.md)

## How to Think About Design
Design questions are about **trade-offs**, not correctness.

Ask:
- What problem am I optimizing for?
- What failure modes am I accepting?
- What does this design make harder to troubleshoot?

## Thinking Drills
- When does segmentation help more than it hurts?
- When does centralization become a liability?
