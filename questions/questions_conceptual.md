# Conceptual Thinking

⬅️ Back to [Questions README](README.md)

## How to Think
When learning a concept, always ask:
- What problem does this solve?
- What breaks if this is missing?
- Which OSI layer does it live in?

## Thinking Drills
- Subnetting: what *constraint* does it introduce?
- OSI model: why separate layers at all?
- VLANs: what problem would exist without them?
