# IPv4 Addressing & Subnetting

## 1. Overview
IPv4 addressing and subnetting define how networks are segmented, routed, and secured. This is the most critical CCNA topic because it underpins routing, NAT, ACLs, and troubleshooting.

## 2. Goals for Mastery
- Convert CIDR notation to subnet masks instantly
- Identify network, broadcast, and usable host ranges
- Calculate hosts per subnet mentally
- Perform subnetting accurately under time pressure

## 3. Concept List
- IPv4 address structure
- CIDR notation
- Subnet masks
- Network vs broadcast address
- Usable host range
- Hosts per subnet
- Subnet increments
