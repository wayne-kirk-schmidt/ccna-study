# Networking Foundations – CCNA-Aligned Knowledge Pack

This repository is a structured, topic-oriented knowledge pack covering core networking concepts,
aligned with CCNA-level expectations.

The current focus is **conceptual mastery + exam relevance**, expressed as concise Markdown
modules. Over time, this will expand into a broader **reference + strategy + tooling** system.

---

## Current Contents

Each file represents a focused study module with:
- Overview
- Goals for mastery
- Core concepts
- Sample questions & answers
- Approximate exam weighting

### Core Networking Topics

## How to Use This Pack

Suggested usage patterns:

- **Sequential study** (recommended for CCNA prep)  
  Start with IPv4/Subnetting → OSI → Switching → Routing → Services → Security → Wireless → Automation

- **Just-in-time reference**  
  Jump directly to a topic when troubleshooting, designing, or reviewing concepts.

- **Teaching / mentoring aid**  
  Each file is self-contained and suitable for walkthroughs or discussion-based learning.

---

## Planned Extensions (Next Phases)

This repository is intentionally modular. Planned additions include:

- **Terms & Definitions**
- **Common Interview / Exam Questions**
- **Design & Strategy Notes**
- **Tools & Commands (vendor-neutral first)**
- **RFC Reference Lists**
- **OSI-Layer-Mapped Troubleshooting Guides**

These will be added as **new files and directories**, without breaking existing structure.

---

## Design Philosophy

- Concept first, syntax second  
- Vendor-neutral by default  
- OSI-layer reasoning everywhere  
- Clear mental models over memorization  

This is meant to be *used*, not just read.

---

## Status

- Current state: **Foundational / Stable**
- Safe to extend
- Safe to reorganize later if needed
