# RFCs & Standards

⬅️ Back to [Main README](../README.md)

## Purpose
RFCs exist to solve **specific problems**, not to be memorized.

This directory focuses on understanding:
- Why an RFC exists
- What behavior it standardizes
- How it maps to OSI layers and real-world systems

## Files
- [Core Networking RFCs](rfc_core_networking.md)
- [Routing RFCs](rfc_routing.md)
- [Transport RFCs](rfc_transport.md)
- [Security RFCs](rfc_security.md)
- [Wireless Standards](rfc_wireless.md)
