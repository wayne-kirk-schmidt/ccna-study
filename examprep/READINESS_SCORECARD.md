# CCNA Readiness Scorecard

This scorecard estimates **exam readiness**, not confidence.

## Scoring

Rate each area honestly from 0–3.

| Score | Meaning |
|------:|--------|
| 0 | Cannot explain or apply |
| 1 | Understand conceptually |
| 2 | Can apply with time |
| 3 | Instant recall under pressure |

## Core Areas

| Topic | Weight | Score (0–3) | Weighted |
|------|--------|-------------|----------|
| Subnetting | 20 |   |   |
| Switching & VLANs | 15 |   |   |
| Routing | 15 |   |   |
| OSI/TCP-IP | 10 |   |   |
| Inter-VLAN Routing | 10 |   |   |
| NAT & IP Services | 10 |   |   |
| ACLs & Security | 10 |   |   |
| Wireless | 5 |   |   |
| Automation | 5 |   |   |

## Interpretation

- **85–100**: Exam ready
- **70–84**: Borderline, fix weak spots
- **<70**: Not ready yet

Rule: Do not schedule the exam until subnetting is a 3.
