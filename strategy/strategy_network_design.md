## How to Think About Design
Design is about **constraints and trade-offs**, not perfection.

Ask yourself:
- What must never fail?
- What is allowed to fail?
- What must be easy to change later?

## Mental Models
- Fewer components = fewer failure modes
- Clear boundaries simplify reasoning
- Design choices shape future troubleshooting
