# Strategy & Decision-Making

⬅️ Back to [Main README](../README.md)

## Purpose
This directory focuses on **how to reason about choices**, not configurations.

Strategy answers questions like:
- What problem are we actually solving?
- What trade-offs are we accepting?
- What failures are we designing for?

These files are most useful *before* touching tools or configs.

## Files
- [Network Design Strategy](strategy_network_design.md)
- [Troubleshooting Strategy](strategy_troubleshooting.md)
- [Scalability Strategy](strategy_scalability.md)
- [Security Strategy](strategy_security.md)
