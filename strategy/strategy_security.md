# Security Strategy

⬅️ Back to [Strategy README](README.md)

## How to Think About Security
Security is a **risk management problem**, not a binary state.

Ask:
- What are we protecting?
- From whom?
- At what cost?

## Strategic Principles
- Least privilege
- Assume breach
- Visibility before control
