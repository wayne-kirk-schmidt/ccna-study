# Scalability Strategy

⬅️ Back to [Strategy README](README.md)

## How to Think About Growth
Scalability is about **predictable behavior under load**.

Ask:
- What happens at 10× load?
- Which component saturates first?
- Can humans keep up?

## Key Ideas
- Horizontal beats vertical
- Automation is a scaling tool
