# CLI Observation Tools

⬅️ Back to [Tools README](README.md)

## How to Think About CLI Tools
CLI tools give **direct visibility** into system state.

Ask:
- What state am I trying to observe?
- Which OSI layer am I validating?
- What identifier should change?

## Examples
- ping: validates reachability (IP)
- traceroute: reveals path behavior
